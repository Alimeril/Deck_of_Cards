In this project, we used python "arcade" library which is a game engine, to create a sandbox simulator game of a deck of cards. This game provides a deck of cards and free area to play whatever game you want with the cards. It also has complete accessibility to whatever you want, such as: dealing face-up or face-down, flipping cards, moving cards freely, reset the deck in order or shuffling the cards.

Below is a picture of game gui:
